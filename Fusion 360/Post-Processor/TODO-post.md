# TODO: *POST-PROCESSOR*

Here we'll have a list of features that I've consider implementing on the *post-processor* in the future, after the initial release.

As they are implemented they will be checked.

## Planned features

- [ ] Set G0 feed rate on option to replace G1 with G0;
- [ ] Update onSection() to remove redundant code;
- [ ] Allow user to select an option to move the table forward after CNC to make the machined part more accessible;
