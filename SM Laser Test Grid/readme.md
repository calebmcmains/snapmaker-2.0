# Snapmaker Laser Test Grid

## Background

Do you ever feel the need to tweak the speed and power of the laser when engraving on your Snapmaker and were not sure what setting to use on a specific material?

I do!

So, I decided to create this windows tool that allows to create and export G-Code compatible with the Snapmaker Marlin flavoured controller to burn a matrix with 10 different laser power values at 10 different speeds.

This can be found on this separate GitHub reporitory [Snapmaker Laser Test Grid](https://github.com/nunorvoliveira/Snapmaker-Laser-Test-Grid)
